Node: The vertices in a tree are called nodes. They may contain data such as an integer value, or their children nodes.
Edges: As in general polygons, edges connect vertices (or in this case nodes).
Root: The node at the top, which is an ancestor for all other nodes is called the root (yes, the tree we study in data structures is kind of an inverted real life tree where root is at the top and branching takes place as we go down).
Leaves: The nodes with no children, i.e., the nodes in the last layer are called leaf nodes.
Depth of a node: Length of the path from root to node.
Height of a node: Length of the longest path from the node to a leaf.

Space Complexity: for traversals
Recursive: O(h) (due to function call stack, h = tree height)
Iterative (BFS): O(w) (queue can grow to hold the maximum width of the tree)
